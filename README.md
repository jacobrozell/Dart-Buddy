# Dart Buddy

<img src="Resources/Media.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/AppIcon.png" alt="Dart Buddy app icon" width="120" />

**Dart Buddy** is a local-first iOS scorekeeper for X01 and Cricket darts. The Xcode target and Swift module are named **DartBuddy** (`import DartBuddy`).

Product behavior and UX contracts live under [`specs/`](specs/README.md). This file is the repo entry point — not a second spec.

## Status (1.0 RC)

- **Product:** MVP scope complete — play, players, history, statistics, settings.
- **Remaining for App Store:** QA sign-off, accessibility evidence, migration recovery smoke, listing assets — tracked in [`docs/release/todo.md`](docs/release/todo.md).

## Getting started

Requirements: Xcode 16+, iOS 17+, [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) 2.44+.

```bash
brew install xcodegen   # if needed
xcodegen generate
open DartBuddy.xcodeproj
```

Copy `Resources/GoogleService-Info.plist.example` to `Resources/GoogleService-Info.plist` and replace placeholders with values from the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) (Project settings → Your apps → iOS). The example uses bundle ID `com.jacobrozell.DartBuddy` — add or update the iOS app in Firebase to match before shipping.

> **App Store continuity:** Changing the bundle ID from `com.jacobrozell.DartsScoreboard` means a new App Store listing (not an in-place update). To keep the existing listing, set `PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER` back to the old value in `project.yml` and regenerate.

**Analytics (1.0):** Release builds with a real `GoogleService-Info.plist` send a small allowlist of product-health events (`app_open`, `match_started`, `match_completed`, `turn_submitted`, `undo_used`, etc.) via the existing `AppLogger` → Firebase Analytics sink. Debug builds stay off unless you add the launch argument `-firebase_analytics_debug`. UI tests pass `-disable_firebase_analytics`.

**Crashlytics (1.0):** Release builds with a real plist also enable Firebase Crashlytics (native crashes + allowlisted non-fatal `error`/`fault` logger events). A **Firebase Crashlytics** run script uploads dSYMs on **Release** archives only (skipped for placeholder plist / CI). Debug stays off unless `-firebase_analytics_debug` (shared switch with analytics). Disable telemetry for local runs with `-disable_firebase_analytics` or UI tests with `-ui_test_reset`. To verify a test crash in Debug: add launch argument `-crashlytics_test_crash` (fatal; sends on next launch).

Run tests: **Product → Test** (`⌘U`), or:

```bash
xcodebuild test -scheme DartBuddy \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16'
```

> `DartBuddy.xcodeproj` is generated locally and not committed. Regenerate after pulling `project.yml` changes.

### CI

GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs on every push and pull request to `master`/`main`: installs XcodeGen, regenerates the project, then `xcodebuild test` on the `DartBuddy` scheme (unit + UI tests) using an available iPhone simulator on the macOS runner.

## What the app does

High-level summary only — authoritative rules are in feature specs:

- X01 and Cricket matches with guided scoring, undo, and bot opponents
- Match setup with roster selection, turn order, and mode-specific options
- Resume in-progress matches; match summary on completion
- Player management (create, edit, archive, delete)
- Match history with filtering and detail views; dedicated statistics tab
- Settings: appearance, default game options, haptics, sound, bot pacing

## Project layout

| Path | Role |
|------|------|
| `App/` | Entry point, dependency wiring, tab shell, navigation |
| `Features/` | Play, History, Players, Statistics, Settings screens |
| `Domain/` | Rules engines, entities, business logic |
| `Data/` | Repository protocols and SwiftData implementations |
| `Persistence/` | Schema, migrations, container factory |
| `DesignSystem/` | Tokens, shared components, gameplay layout |
| `Resources/` | Asset catalog, `en.lproj` strings, Firebase plist template |
| `Support/` | Localization, logging, preferences, utilities |
| `Tests/` | `Unit/`, `Accessibility/`, and `UI/` test sources (three Xcode targets) |
| `docs/release/` | Active backlog (`todo.md`) and App Store runbook (`release_checklist.md`) |
| `specs/` | Product and system specifications |
| `roadmap/` | Phase delivery plan and release artifacts |
| `accessibility/` | WCAG 2.1 AA tracker and manual verification |

## App flow

1. `App/DartBuddyApp.swift` bootstraps dependencies.
2. `App/MainTabView.swift` presents Play, Players, Statistics, History, and Settings tabs.
3. Feature root views own their view models and navigation.
